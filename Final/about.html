				<h2>About Me</h2>
				
				<p>I am a Game Design student currently studying at Illinois State University. I hail from the beatiful little village Mokena Illinois, where I spent my early days falling in love with all things games. Growing up I had a lot of exposure to both analog and digital games. My early digital games came in the form of titles such as Command and Conquer, Pokemon, and Crash Bandicoot. Outside of games, my childhood also included longboarding, sports, and Tuba performance. While I gave up tuba when I moved away for college, I still try to reference it in my works to pay homage to the time I spent playing and my older brother Mike, without him I would have never set my life on this path, so I am eternally greatful.<br>
                    
                Currently I Reside in Normal Illinois, Studying at Illinois State University, my exposure to games and art in all forms has increased tenfold and has broadened my horizions. While at University, I have began on new projects I would have never conceptualized without a new enviroment. I am pretty involved in the local music scene and have made valuable connections with musicians interested in writing and recording original soundtracks for my Games.<br>

                Also because I havent talked about him at all (shockingly) here is a picture of my cat Romeo.<br>
